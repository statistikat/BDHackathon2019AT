## Challenges

**How can innovative solutions for data collection reduce response burden and enrich or replace the statistical information/data provided by the time use survey?**

The challenge is not only limited to currently collected information but could also be extended to information needs that cannot be satisfied with existing methods. Your solution should be based on relevant data, statistical analysis and visualisation. You are also invited to establish links between various data sets and to identify and use other data sources beyond those currently at hand. The tool should integrate or at least consider the aspect of data quality for the analysis and visualisation. Your solution could extend statistical information to additional areas or intensify information on existing areas, such as:

* social well-being,
* work-life balance,
* use of information and communication technologies,
* mobility and travel,
* physical activity,
* social environment,
* geographical context,
* regularity and frequency of activities,
* recognition and registration of episodes,
* innovative time-space policy dashboards
* informing on relevant SDGs
* ...
